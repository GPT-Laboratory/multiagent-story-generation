# Multiagent-Prioritization

Multiagent-Prioritization prioritizes user stories generated by a GPT model. You can input content directly or upload a file to generate user stories. Prioritization uses single or multiple techniques, with multi-agent discussion to reach a final prioritization table.

## Quick Links

- **Live server**: <http://86.50.228.158:8000/login>  
- **Demo video**: at the end of this README

## Features

- **Content input or file upload** to get user stories from the GPT model  
- **Single or multi-technique prioritization**  
- **Multi-agent discussions** (three agents) to select and apply techniques, then output a final table

## Environment

- A **`.env.sample` file is included**.  
  - Copy it to `.env` and fill values before running.  
  - Example: `cp .env.sample .env`
- Do **not** commit `.env`. Ensure `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Starlette, WebSockets, Uvicorn  
- **Frontend**: React (build or dev server)  
- **Databases/Services**: **Supabase**, **MongoDB** (stores agent configurations), **OpenAI** (three API keys used)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- Node.js 18+  
- MongoDB connection (Atlas or self-hosted)  
- Supabase project (URL + keys)  
- Three OpenAI API keys

## Setup

### 1) Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiagent-Prioritization.git
cd multiagent-Prioritization


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiagent-Prioritization.git OR the repo address 
    cd multiagent-directory
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt or  pip install starlette uvicorn httpx python-dotenv streamlit python-multipart
    ```
3: npm i to instal the packages, if you want to change in the fronent end, can use npm run build or can run live frontend server using npm run dev
   Can use dist folder 


### Usage

1. Start the Starlette server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### User Flow

#### Step 1: Select Input Type

- **Content Input**: Directly enter the content for generating user stories.
- **Upload File**: Upload a file containing the content for generating user stories.

#### Step 2: Select Prioritization Method

After receiving the user stories, select the prioritization method:

- **Single Technique Prioritization**: Choose one technique for prioritization.
  - Three agents will discuss the chosen technique.
  - After the discussion, the final prioritization table is displayed.


### API Endpoints

- `POST /generate`: Generate user stories from input content or uploaded file.
- `POST /prioritize`: Prioritize the generated user stories using selected technique(s).

### WebSockets

WebSockets are used to facilitate real-time communication between the client and the server, enabling multi-agent discussions and live updates of the prioritization process.


#### Step 1: Select Input Type
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

Open: http://127.0.0.1:8000 or your deployed URL.

Login page (deployment): http://86.50.228.158:8000/login

rontend
Dev: npm run dev

Build: npm run build then serve /dist (or integrate with backend static hosting)

User Flow
Select input type

Content input

File upload

Generate user stories

Select prioritization method

Single technique

Multi-technique

Multi-agent discussion â†’ final prioritization table

API Endpoints
POST /generate
Input: raw text or file
Output: user stories

POST /prioritize
Input: user stories + technique(s)
Output: prioritized table (JSON)

WebSockets
Used for real-time multi-agent discussion and live updates of prioritization progress to the client.

Security Notes
Keep .env private.

Rotate OpenAI keys periodically.

Use Supabase service role key only on the server.

Limit MongoDB network access with IP allow-list or VPC peering.
